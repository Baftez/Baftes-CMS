Hey everyone! We're excited to share the new community website for your World of Warcraft private server. Designed with a classic WoW feel, this platform is packed with features to enhance your experience!

What's inside?

Player Dashboard: Manage your account details, change your password, and view all your in-game characters (level, gold, race, class, gender) directly on the site!
Powerful Admin Panel: For server operators, we've built robust tools to manage WoW game accounts (including GM levels), website users (roles, passwords), and a full-featured News Editor with a rich text editor and even an emoji picker!
Clean & Responsive Design: Enjoy a seamless, WoW-themed experience on any device, thanks to Tailwind CSS and custom styling.
Clean URLs: Our links are now super clean (e.g., /news instead of news.php) for a modern feel.
Ready to set it up for your server?

It's built with PHP and uses MySQL databases. To get started, you'll need to:

Upload the website files to your web server.
Import the necessary MySQL data for website users (and ensure connection to your WoW auth and characters databases).
Edit the config.php file with your specific database credentials.
(If using Apache) Ensure your .htaccess file is set up for clean URLs and custom 404s.
This project is open-source and ready for you to customize!
